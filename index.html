				<h3>Game Developer</h3>
				<p>
					I am a year 1 student at the Ngee Ann
					Polytechnic in the immesive media
					programme where I learn Ui/Ux
					development, basic programming as well
					as game design. I have always been
					interested in game design and have been
					playing games since I was young. I have
					a hobby in self hosing server
					applications and currently i am building
					a new server so i can host my own
					website and applications. I have tried
					using docker and docker composed to host
					my own server applications with limited
					succes but i will keep trying. I am
					trying to learn more about application
					development to develop a way to allow my
					friends to turn on my services(mainly to
					turn on game servers) without me having
					to turn it on for them. My other hobbys
					include gaming and taekwondo. I was
					given my first console at the age of 7
					and was hooked ever since. my first
					console was a gameboy which was
					previously my uncles and was given a
					copy of the original version of pokemon
					which i recall spending countless hours
					on. I have been honing my craft in
					taekwondo since i was 7 and have been a
					black belt since i was 13. I have taken
					a 4 year break as i was preparing for my
					O levels but have recently started
					training again. I have recently gained a
					gold medal in the recent polite
					competition.
