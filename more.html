			<h1>More about me:</h1>
			<p>
				I am a year 1 student at the Ngee Ann Polytechnic in the immesive media
				programme where I learn Ui/Ux development, basic programming as well as
				game design. I have always been interested in game design and have been
				playing games since I was young. I have a hobby in self hosing server
				applications and currently i am building a new server so i can host my
				own website and applications. I have tried using docker and docker
				composed to host my own server applications with limited succes but i
				will keep trying. I am trying to learn more about application
				development to develop a way to allow my friends to turn on my
				services(mainly to turn on game servers) without me having to turn it on
				for them. My other hobbys include gaming and taekwondo. I was given my
				first console at the age of 7 and was hooked ever since. my first
				console was a gameboy which was previously my uncles and was given a
				copy of the original version of pokemon which i recall spending
				countless hours on. I have been honing my craft in taekwondo since i was
                7 and have been a black belt since i was 13. I have taken a 4 year break
                as i was preparing for my O levels but have recently started training again.
                I have recently gained a gold medal in the recent polite competition.
